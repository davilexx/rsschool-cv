### About me

Frontend developer with more than two years of experience working with HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript and 
basics of React. Always using Flexbox, Bootstrap and BEM-methodology in projects. Had experience 
developing online stores using CMS OpenCart. Also worked with PHP, MySQL, Git, npm, Figma, Sketch and 
Adobe Photoshop.
My main goal is to always be a useful part of the team. I’m always open when it comes to communication. 
Can be effective when it comes to finding quick solutions. Always learning.
